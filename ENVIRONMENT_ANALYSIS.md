# System Architecture Analysis & Environment Separation Strategy

## Current Setup Problems

### 1. **Mixed Environment Configuration**

- **Production branch**: `experimental` (deployed to Vercel)
- **Staging work**: Also on `experimental` locally
- **Database confusion**:
  - Production DB: `gogenticboard` (odd-base-81691722) - missing Sprint 1-6 tables
  - Staging DB: `gogentic-portal-staging` (quiet-bonus-39554984) - has all tables

### 2. **What Went Wrong**

1. We developed Sprint 1-6 features locally
2. Sprint 1 was auto-committed and pushed to `experimental` branch
3. Vercel auto-deployed Sprint 1 code to production
4. Production DB didn't have the required tables → **500 errors**
5. Sprints 2-6 were never pushed, creating a mismatch
6. Attempted rollback didn't work because Vercel stopped auto-deploying

### 3. **Root Causes**

- **No environment separation**: Same branch (`experimental`) for both staging and production
- **Database schema mismatch**: Code expects tables that don't exist
- **Vercel deployment issues**: Auto-deploy disconnected or broken
- **No CI/CD pipeline**: Direct pushes to production branch

## Proper Environment Separation Strategy

### 1. **Branch Strategy**

```
main (or production)  → Production deployment
staging               → Staging deployment
develop               → Development work
feature/*             → Feature branches
```

### 2. **Database Strategy**

```
Production DB: gogenticboard (odd-base-81691722)
  - Only tested, stable migrations
  - Backup before any migration

Staging DB: gogentic-portal-staging (quiet-bonus-39554984)
  - Test all migrations here first
  - Can be reset/rebuilt as needed

Local DB: Developer's own Neon branch or local Postgres
  - For active development
```

### 3. **Vercel Projects Setup**

Instead of one Vercel project, create TWO:

**Production Vercel Project**:

- Name: `gogentic-portal-prod`
- Deploys from: `main` branch only
- Environment vars: Points to production DB
- Domain: gogentic-portal.vercel.app

**Staging Vercel Project**:

- Name: `gogentic-portal-staging`
- Deploys from: `staging` branch
- Environment vars: Points to staging DB
- Domain: gogentic-portal-staging.vercel.app

### 4. **Deployment Workflow**

```
1. Develop on feature branch
2. PR to staging branch
3. Auto-deploy to staging Vercel
4. Test in staging environment
5. PR from staging to main
6. Auto-deploy to production Vercel
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Current Situation

```bash
# 1. Keep experimental as is (it's production now)
# 2. Our Sprint 1-6 work is in 'staging' branch
# 3. Create new main branch from stable experimental
git checkout experimental
git checkout -b main
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Separate Vercel Projects

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Create new project: `gogentic-portal-staging`
3. Connect to same GitHub repo but deploy from `staging` branch
4. Set environment variables to staging DB

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

**Production** (.env.production):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@odd-base-81691722...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://gogentic-portal.vercel.app
```

**Staging** (.env.staging):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@quiet-bonus-39554984...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://gogentic-portal-staging.vercel.app
```

### Step 4: Migration Strategy

```bash
# Always migrate staging first
npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma

# Only after staging is stable
# Apply same migration to production
```

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Reconnect Vercel**:
   - Check Vercel dashboard for deployment errors
   - Reconnect GitHub integration if broken

2. **Separate Environments**:
   - Create staging Vercel project
   - Point it to staging branch
   - Keep production on experimental (or move to main)

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Either apply Sprint 1-6 migrations to production DB
   - OR keep production on base version until ready

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never develop directly on production branch**
2. **Always have staging environment that mirrors production**
3. **Test database migrations in staging first**
4. **Use feature branches for development**
5. **Have clear deployment pipeline**
6. **Monitor Vercel deployments - don't assume they work**

## Current Safe State

- **Production**: Rolled back to base version (should work once Vercel deploys)
- **Staging branch**: Has all Sprint 1-6 work saved
- **Staging DB**: Has all tables and is working
- **No data lost**: Everything is preserved

## Next Steps

1. Verify Vercel is deploying from experimental branch
2. Create separate staging Vercel project
3. Deploy staging branch to staging Vercel
4. Test everything in staging
5. When ready, properly migrate production DB and deploy
